## Technical Questions

#### I'm using the `subscribe` method, but I don't receive any data

Make sure to authenticate your module first – to do so call
`COBI.init("YOUR-TOKEN")` before you subscribe to any COBI.js data stream.

#### Any tipps for debugging my module within the COBI app on the phone?

The native app will display javascript errors in a dialog.

#### How do I get a specific version of the COBI.js library?

The following url provides `0.34.0` of COBI.js: *https://cdn.cobi.bike/cobi.js/0.34.0/cobi.js*. 
This will work for any other published version.

## Distribution / Business Model Questions

#### How can I share my module with others?

For now, you can share your work (screenshots, url) with other COBI developers in the [COBI Developer Showtime forum](https://forums.cobi.bike/c/showtime).

#### When and how can I make my module available to COBI users later?
We are in the process of defining distribution mechanisms which are planned to ship in 2018. In the meantime, COBI DevKit enables you to figure out if your idea has legs and what features work best in a biking context. Make sure you comply with the [COBI Interface Guidelines](interface-guidelines.md) and share your results with the developer community [forums.cobi.bike](https://forums.cobi.bike). We'll announce distribution mechanisms to end-users later.

#### Will I be able to make money from my app?

Currently there are no monetization plans via the COBI platform. If you’re offering a commercial service we recommend to view COBI modules as a bike-friendly "springboard" to offer limited, specific functionality suitable for the context of biking. For more advanced functionalities, you can link to your own native app or website. Feel free to use a login to authenticate users for paid functionalities.

#### Any plans to support in-house distribution for enterprises?

We are currently evaluating this option. Please get in touch with us to discuss your requirements.
