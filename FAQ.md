# Technical Questions

* I'm using the `subscribe` method for `X` but I don't receive any data

This usually happens if you forget to authenticate your webapp – to do so call
`COBI.init("YOUR-TOKEN")` before you start subscribing to COBI.js data.

* Any tipps for debugging my module within the COBI app on the phone?

The native app will display javascript errors in a dialog.

* How do I get a specific version of the COBI.js library?

The following url gives you version `0.34.0` of the COBI.js library: *https://cdn.cobi.bike/cobi.js/0.34.0/cobi.js*. This will work for any other published version of the library.

# Distribution Questions

* How can I share my module with my friends?

For now, you can share your work in the Showtime forum within the closed COBI developer group.
When and how can I make my module available to COBI users later?
We are in the process of defining distribution mechanisms which are planned for 2018. In the meantime you can use the COBI DevKit to figure out if your idea has legs and what features work best in a biking context. Make sure you comply with the COBI Interface Guidelines and share your results with the developer community (forums.cobi.bike). We’ll announce distribution mechanisms to COBI users later.

* Will I be able to make money from my app?

Currently, there are no monetization plans via the COBI platform. If you’re offering a commercial service we recommend to see COBI modules as a bike-friendly “springboard” to offer limited functionality in the biking context. For more advanced functionalities, you can link to your own native app or website. Feel free to use a login to authenticate users for paid functionalities.

* Any plans to support in-house distribution for enterprises?

We are currently evaluating this option. Please get in touch to discuss your requirements.
